  * Initial Commit to GitHub
  * This commit contains the shell of the bot, plus working **birthday** and **ping** commands. 
  * Unlike previous editions, this bot has been abstracted into Cogs rather than maintaining all the code in a single file.  Hopefully, this helps us to debug easier and maintain solid readability.
